Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Support and Community
---------------------

**Can you offer support in other languages?**
 - Unfortunately, since so many mods are English-only, Librum itself can't be offered in other languages. However, I can offer support auf Deutsch, en français, en español, или по-русски.

**I have a suggestion!**
 - If you believe your suggestion would be a good fit for Librum, and you don't see it on our `Trello <https://trello.com/b/dYUOOuIv/librum-modpack>`_ or in our #suggestions channel in our `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/BnUHUswABG>`_\ , please fill out this Google Form: https://forms.gle/4nBCPopDgrh1HpxX9.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

**What are all the unchecked mods in MO2?**
 - These are all intentional. I recommend ignoring everything except the "Optional Plugins" at the bottom of the left pane, which are described in the readme.

**How do I improve my framerate?**
 - I'll be trying to improve the performance in the next few updates. For now, try turning down the in-game settings. In particular, supersampling and view distance (especially for actors and grass) are major culprits, and you can see if you prefer turning Dynamic Resolution off. If that isn't good enough, the last resort is to disable the ENB.
**When I level up, I still get a perk!**
 - Check your "Librum/overwrite" folder for a "SKSE/plugins/SkyrimUncapper.ini**, and delete it.
**What are the weird enemies below [insert city name]?**
 - You've encountered Skyrim Underground. I've patched away the worst offenders, but I recognize that I've got some more work to do in this department.

 
**What difficulty setting is recommended?**
 - I personally use Master, although the settings are all decently balanced. Feel it out for yourself, but don't feel bad about decreasing the difficulty!

**Some of the voice acting is too loud/not great.**
 - You probably have Death Consumes All active. If so, I did warn you =). If not, please let me know.

**I don't want survival features.**
 - This is possible. Activate SunHelm and Frostfall when the readme tells you to, but then exit and re-enter the menu and deactivate them again.

**The Bashed Patch is disabled/several mods in the left pane are disabled/LOOT says to reorder the mods.**
 - This is all intentional, and messing with it will break your game.
