*You’re lost in the woods, having narrowly escaped after scaring off a pack of wolves with your travel lantern. Your lantern’s oil finally runs dry, and it’s getting cold. You can conjure basic food and shelter, but your spells all seem to fizzle out in this weather. You need to gather wood in order to sustain a fire and survive the night. With little time to spare, you can’t search far for materials — luckily, you’ve fashioned a basic hatchet the night before, and you can chop down a nearby tree for lumber. After many failed attempts, you sustain a weak flame spell long enough to light your campfire. You fall asleep next to your fire, having prayed to Kynareth to fend off would-be predators. Despite a few interruptions in the night, the morning comes at last, and the sun finally breaks over the horizon.*

Skyrim SE and VR are both wonderful experiences, but both very familiar ones. Even with all of the modern improvements, we visit the same locales and repeat the same adventures we have since the end of 2011.

*Librum* is a comprehensive gameplay, graphics, and content overhaul that attempts to change all of this. Combining together some of the best and most popular mods for Skyrim SE, a suite of new quests and adventures that outnumber Skyrim's own, the tradition of great "hardcore" gameplay overhauls that have come before -- like Skyrim's Requiem, and YASH, or Oblivion's Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul -- and a host of unique-to-VR immersion improvements, Librum brings new life (and new challenge!) to Skyrim in a way that has never been experienced before.

Librum is available for both VR and SE. 

Installation Guide
------------------
.. raw:: html

We used to have a link to a video guide here, but it is no longer accurate as of the 3.0 update. The MCM is now configured completely for you. That's right, you can create a character and just start playing!

For more detailed installation information, please see the Installation tab on the left.
