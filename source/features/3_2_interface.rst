User Interface
--------------

Librum makes a few changes to the default user interface, to (a) create a unique visual experience and (b) to improve the VR experience. For the first point, Librum uses `SkyUI <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604>`_ along with the excellent `Dear Diary UI <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010>`_ and pieces of the `Adventurer Theme Mod <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35568>`_ in order to blend a Skyrim-style modern UI with touches of a more Oblivion-style classic visual theme:

We recognize that UIs, HUDs, Fonts and ENBs are all very personal and subjective choices, so as of 2.0 we've begun to look deeper at providing bundled options so you don't need to go rogue just to make things look the way you like! To start, we've provided a Font Selector to switch between several different options along with two different HUD presets. We hope to provide many more options to come in future releases.
